This plugin aims to bring TinyMCE version 5.x to the ClassiPress editor.

Please install the plugin and give it a try. Don't be gentle. Put it through the paces. Try weird things. Actively try to break it. And then report your findings here! 

If we can hammer out the issues, we can get the ClassicPress editor updated to use the current version of TinyMCE â€“ which is super sweeeeet, I might add!
